## Suggested additions (optional)
If you later want to expand this folder further, add:
- a short “User Journey” (homepage → services → contact/appointment → confirmation)
- a mini plugin inventory table (Plugin | Purpose | Key settings | Status)
- performance checks (caching, image optimisation, backups)

Place any exports/extra files in:
- `assets/docs/` (do not rename existing screenshots)
